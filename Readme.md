## About The Project

## STILL WIP

**Booqquery** is a CLI accounting tool with the ability to connect to
**Starling** bank sync transactions to MongoDB database and add tags and
calculate totals and export the data to excel files. In the future there will be
a feature to generate **invoices** and more.
